Sales Analysis Dashboard by Power BI
I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance, helping businesses gain deep insights and make smarter strategic decisions.

 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
 Total Orders: 25K 
 Total Sales: $12.64M 
 Total Profit: $1.47M 
 Net Sales: $11.82M
 Average Order Value: $504.99
 Total Returns: 1K orders 

 What does this dashboard offer?
Sales analysis by category & product to identify the most profitable items.
Sales trends by cities & customers to understand market behavior.
Discount impact analysis to assess its effect on sales & profit.
Return tracking to uncover issues and improve operations.

 Outcome: A clear sales performance overview that empowers businesses to optimize strategies and drive growth!
